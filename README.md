# Fetch and Spying Demo App

This is a very bare-bones application built to demonstrate how to make and test a fetch call.
The application is meant to query the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod), but can be modified to work with any public API.

## Installation and Running
To install and run the project:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/fetch-async-testing.git # clone down repo

cd fetch-async-testing # navigate to the root directory of the project

npm install # install dependencies

npm start # begin running a local server
```

Then navigate to the local server in your browser to view the application.
